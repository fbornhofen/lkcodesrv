Code Server for Lively
======================
This is an experiment to serve Lively code off a database. 


Prerequisites:
==============
You need to have Node.js and npm installed. We currently run on version 0.4.12 (stable) of Node.js.
Development files of the following packages are necessary to build the required Node.js modules:
- libxml2
- sqlite3
On Linux, you can usually install these through your package manager (*-dev or *-devel). On OSX, install these programs using MacPorts or Homebrew.


Installation:
=============
- Check out this git repository
- cd to your local clone and run "npm install". This installs a few additional modules.
- Copy config.js.default to config.js. You can configure things like lkcodesrv's port number there.


Running Lively Kernel on lkcodesrv
==================================
- Run "node codesrv.js" to start the server
- Initialize database through route http://YOUR_HOSTNAME:PORT_FROM_config.js/setup
- Get a copy of the Lively Kernel code. You can get zipped snapshots from here: http://lively-kernel.org/other/releases/ or check out the lively github repository.
- Run "./import-code.sh <PATH_TO_YOUR_LIVELY_CODE> <PORT>" to copy your local LK files to the database.
- Open http://YOUR_HOSTNAME:PORT/blank.xhtml in your web browser (Chrome, preferably).
Enjoy!
